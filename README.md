Y'ello. I'm Sax, my usual usernames of Sax850 or other variants was all taken so I went with SaxProfanityBandit.
I'm currently in a DevOps course through a vocational school so my projects will mostly be related towards that. However I'm a huge user of the VTT program FoundryVTT
and might do projects related to that in the future.
